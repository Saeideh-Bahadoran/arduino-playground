 
# Hello LCD – Arduino + LCD Display (Wokwi Project)

This is my first embedded project using [Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/), where I learned how to connect and control a simple LCD display using an Arduino.

## 🔧 Project Description

The project displays the  **"Hi Saeideh!"** message on a 16x2 LCD using the Arduino platform.

### 🛠️ Components Used:
- Arduino Uno
- 16x2 LCD Display

### 💡 What I Learned:
- How to simulate hardware projects online using Wokwi
- How to connect and configure an LCD screen
- Basics of Arduino `LiquidCrystal` library
- How to structure a basic embedded project

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Open the project in Wokwi: [Open in Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/projects/YOUR_PROJECT_ID)
2. Press the "Start Simulation" button
3. You will see "Hi Saeideh!" displayed on the LCD
4. And in the next lines you will see other sentenses and a counter tha counts every 1 second.
