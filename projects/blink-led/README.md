# 🔁 Alternating Blink – Arduino + Two LEDs (Wokwi Project)

This is my second embedded project using [Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/), where I explored how to control two LEDs using an Arduino Uno. The LEDs blink alternately, creating a simple but useful timing exercise.

## 🔧 Project Description

The project toggles two LEDs (connected to pins 12 and 13) so that one turns on while the other turns off, with a 1-second delay in between. This demonstrates basic digital output control and timing in Arduino.

### 🛠️ Components Used:
- Arduino Uno (Wokwi simulator)
- 1 LED (connected to pin 12) and 1 onboard-LED connected to pin 13 

### 💡 What I Learned:
- How to control multiple digital outputs using `pinMode()` and `digitalWrite()`
- How to blink two LEDs alternately
- Using the `delay()` function for timing
- Basics of logic and timing in microcontroller programming

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Open the project in Wokwi: [Open in Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/projects/INSERT-YOUR-PROJECT-ID)
2. Press the "Start Simulation" button
3. You will see the two LEDs blinking **alternately every second**

## 🧠 Author Notes
This is **Day 2** of my personal journey into Embedded Systems and IoT.  
I’m building small daily projects to learn the foundations of embedded programming, hardware simulation, and professional documentation.
